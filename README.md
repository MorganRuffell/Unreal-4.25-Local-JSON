## Unreal Engine JSON Implementation

This is a simple programming project built on the back of the Unreal Engine RPG Template that works with the FGameplayAbilitySystem.

The purpose of this project was to experiment with creating new systems inside of Unreal Engine 4.25, and refactor existing Blueprint code to C++. This was more of a learning 
exercise than anything else. 

This is not a production ready project, it's more of creating an interesting back end that allows the creation of JSON objects that allow modification of game data at runtime.
this project was produced as part of Games System Design as part of my Degree in Games Technology.

The project uses the darker nodes and the electronic nodes plugin inside of the editor.
